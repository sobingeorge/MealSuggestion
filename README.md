This is a test project, Recipe suggestion.
The project services the frontend by hitting a open API.
This project has been created using Spring Boot, and necessary libraries have been used to aid development, like lombok.
The project has major limitations as the suggested API store - Documenu was not available to be used.
The other API edamam also was not returning results on search criteria on their documentation page.
Hence the project fetches a single recipe, making use of the edamam api "ttps://api.edamam.com/api/recipes/v2/"

The app runs on 8080 port.
Swagger URL: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

The project's dockerized version was used for integrating with the UI, which is written on React.
